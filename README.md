# S達o Paulo Agora

S達o Paulo Agora is an application that gathers relevant information from S達o Paulo's area and
pushes them to Push.co on a timed basis, so users always get the latest information as they need
them.

Currently it supports:

* Morning feed with today's forecast
* Important news from the city and its surroundings
* Traffic alerts on peak hours


## Usage

S達o Paulo Agora relies on PHP to work, and each channel has its own cli command:

`php run.php [command] sao-paulo`

In this, [command] is either `weather`, `news` or `traffic`. When called, the most relevant data is
retrieved from the other services' APIs and pushed to their respective channel.
